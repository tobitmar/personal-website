                <p> My name is Margaret Ologban, I am currently a student at the university of 
                    Texas at Dallas who majors in Computer Science. I am planning on going into the cybersecurity branch
                    of Computer Science, while developing my skills in languages such as C++, Java, and more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an
                    upcoming eSports editor for the award winning student media publication, The Mercury, for UT Dallas.
                    In my free time I enjoy playing video games and listening to various types of music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Austin, Texas, and grew up in central Texas. I moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area for college,
                    and I have been enjoying my time here! I like going out to eat in Carrolton, Texas the most.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to work on projects using my future and present skills. Cybersecurity is a big interest of mine,
                    but also working on websites and back-end coding is something I am open to as well as I go further in my
                    education. I hope we work together well in the future.
